Most studies require the temporal aggregation of edges (or events) into discrete time steps to perform analysis. In this article we describe a static, lossless, and unique representation of a temporal network, the temporal event graph (TEG). The TEG describes the temporal network in terms of both the inter-event time and two-event temporal motif distributions. By considering these distributions in unison we provide a new method to characterise the behaviour of individuals and collectives in temporal networks as well as providing a natural decomposition of the network. We illustrate the utility of the TEG by providing examples on both synthetic and real temporal networks.",

In this model, each individual supports one of two parties and is either a susceptible voter of type q1 or q2, or is an inflexible zealot. At each time step, a qi-susceptible voter (i=1,2) consults a group of qi neighbors and adopts their opinion if all group members agree, while zealots are inflexible and never change their opinion. This model violates detailed balance whenever q1\u2260q2 and is characterized by two distinct regimes of low and high density of zealotry. Here, by combining analytical and numerical methods, we investigate the non-equilibrium stationary state of the system in terms of its probability distribution, non-vanishing currents and unequal-time two-point correlation functions. We also study the switching times properties of the model by exploiting an approximate mapping onto the model of [Phys. Rev. E 92, 012803 (2015)] that satisfies the detailed balance, and also outline some properties of the model near criticality.",

At each time step, a qi-susceptible voter (i=1,2) consults a group of qi neighbors and adopts their opinion if all group members agree, while zealots are inflexible and never change their opinion.

Here, we focus on the characterization of the model\u2019s non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in terms of its probability distribution and currents in the distinct regimes of low and high density of zealotry. We unveil the NESS properties in each of these phases by computing the opinion distribution and the circulation of probability currents, as well as the two-point correlation functions at unequal times (formally related to a \u201cprobability angular momentum\u201d).

                "abstract": "We generalize the classical Bass model of innovation diffusion to include a new class of agents --- Luddites --- that oppose the spread of innovation. Our model also incorporates ignorants, susceptibles, and adopters. When an ignorant and a susceptible meet, the former is converted to a susceptible at a given rate, while a susceptible spontaneously adopts the innovation at a constant rate. In response to the rate of adoption, an ignorant may become a Luddite and permanently reject the innovation. Instead of reaching complete adoption, the final state generally consists of a population of Luddites, ignorants, and adopters. The evolution of this system is investigated analytically and by stochastic simulations. We determine the stationary distribution of adopters, the time needed to reach the final state, and the influence of the network topology on the innovation spread. Our model exhibits an important dichotomy: when the rate of adoption is low, an innovation spreads slowly but widely; in contrast, when the adoption rate is high, the innovation spreads rapidly but the extent of the adoption is severely limited by Luddites.",

                "abstract": "Recent advances in data collection and storage have allowed both researchers and industry alike to collect data in real time. Much of this data comes in the form of 'events', or timestamped interactions, such as email and social media posts, website clickstreams, or protein-protein interactions. This of type data poses new challenges for modelling, especially if we wish to preserve all temporal features and structure. We propose a generalised framework to explore temporal networks using second-order time-unfolded models, called event graphs. Through examples we demonstrate how event graphs can be used to understand the higher-order topological-temporal structure of temporal networks and capture properties of the network that are unobserved when considering either a static (or time-aggregated) model. Furthermore, we show that by modelling a temporal network as an event graph our analysis extends easily to consider non-dyadic interactions, known as hyper-events.",

                "abstract": "Many studies of digital communication, in particular of Twitter, use natural language processing (NLP) to find topics, assess sentiment, and describe user behaviour. In finding topics often the relationships between users who participate in the topic are neglected. We propose a novel method of describing and classifying online conversations using only the structure of the underlying temporal network and not the content of individual messages. This method utilises all available information in the temporal network (no aggregation), combining both topological and temporal structure using temporal motifs and inter-event times. This allows us create an embedding of the temporal network in order to describe the behaviour of individuals and collectives over time and examine the structure of conversation over multiple timescales.",
